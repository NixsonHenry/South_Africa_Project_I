    <p>
        Cape Town is the second biggest city of South Africa. It is also home to the South African Parliament where the country's representatives assemble. It is at the Cape of Good Hope on the south-west coast. It has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate. The city's dominant natural feature is Table Mountain, a mountain with a flat top. It was originally called the "Cape of Storms" by Bartolomeu Dias in 1486,[1] a Portuguese explorer but was changed by King John II of Portugal to "Cape of Good Hope". The town was started as the center of the Dutch Cape Colony in 1652.
